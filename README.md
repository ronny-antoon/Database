# Database
 The NVSDatabase library is a C++ library that provides an interface for working with the ESP-IDF's Non-volatile Storage (NVS) API. NVS is used for storing configuration data and other non-volatile information on ESP32 and ESP8266 microcontrollers. This library is designed to facilitate the storage and retrieval of key-value pairs in the NVS database.
